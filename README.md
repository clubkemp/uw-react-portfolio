# React Portfolio

  ## Description 
  React is HOT right now, so practice practice practice is key in handling these hot coals. This portfolio project is a result of the practice. Essentially refactoring a codebase I wrote using Pure and Shoelace into a reactive application. Sort of overkill for content serving. Part of this was learning how a framework functions in the realm of react. Pre-packaged components and grids via Material UI. Fun stuff.
